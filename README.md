[> Intro
--------
<a id="intro"></a>

We know what you'll first ask when discovering this new SDR project: what's the RFIC? 🤔 Let's answer straight away: Another **AD936X**-based SDR! 😄

Why yet another SDR based on this RFIC? Because we've been designing FPGA-based projects for clients with this chip for almost 10 years now and still think this RFIC has incredible capabilities and possibilities that haven't been fully tapped by open-source projects. We believe it can provide a fantastic and simple solution when paired with the [LiteX](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex) framework we're developing. 🚀

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex_m2sdr/assets/1450143/1a3f2d76-b406-4928-b3ed-2767d317757e" width="100%">
</div>

Imagine a minimalist AD9361-based SDR with:
- A compact form factor (M2 2280). 📏
- Minimal on-board RF frontend that could be specialized externally.
- 2T2R / 12-bit @ 61.44MSPS (and 2T2R / 12-bit @ 122.88MSPS for those wanting to use/explore Cellwizard/BladeRF [findings](https://www.nuand.com/2023-02-release-122-88mhz-bandwidth/)).
- PCIe Gen 2 X4 (~14Gbps of TX/RX bandwidth) with [LitePCIe](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litepcie), providing MMAP and several possible DMAs (for direct I/Q samples transfer or processed I/Q samples). ⚡
- A large XC7A200T FPGA where the base infrastructure only uses a fraction of the available resources, allowing you to integrate large RF processing blocks. 💪
- The option to reuse some of the PCIe lanes of the M2 connector for 1Gbps or 2.5Gbps Ethernet through [LiteEth](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/liteeth). 🌐
- Or ... for SATA through [LiteSATA](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litesata). 💾
- Or ... for inter-board SerDes-based communication through [LiteICLink](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/liteiclink). 🔗
- Powerful debug capabilities through LiteX [Host <-> FPGA bridges](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/Use-Host-Bridge-to-control-debug-a-SoC) and [LiteScope](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litescope) logic analyzer. 🛠️
- Multiboot support to allow secure remove update over PCIe (or Ethernet).
- ...and we hope a welcoming/friendly community as we strive to encourage in LiteX! 🤗

OK, you probably also realized this project is a showcase for LiteX capabilities, haha. 😅 Rest assured, we'll do our best to gather and implement your requests to make this SDR as flexible and versatile as possible!

This board is proudly developed in France 🇫🇷 by [Enjoy-Digital](http://enjoy-digital.fr/), managing the project and litex_m2sdr/gateware/software development, and our partner [Lambdaconcept](https://shop.lambdaconcept.com/) designing the hardware. 🥖🍷

Ideal for SDR enthusiasts, this versatile board fits directly into an M2 slot or can team up with others in a PCIe M2 carrier for more complex projects, including coherent MIMO SDRs. 🔧

For Ethernet support with 1000BaseX/2500BaseX and SATA connectivity to directly record/play samples to/from an SSD, mount it on the LiteX Acorn Mini Baseboard! 💽

[> PCIe SoC Design
------------------
<a id="pcie-soc-design"></a>

The PCIe design is the first variant developed for the board and does not require an additional baseboard. Just pop the M2SDR into a PCIe M2 slot, connect your antennas, and you're ready to go! 🚀

The SoC has the following architecture:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex_m2sdr/assets/1450143/df5eb55e-16b2-4724-b4c1-28e06c45279c" width="100%">
</div>

- The SoC is built with the LiteX framework, allowing highly efficient HDL coding and integration. 💡
- You'll also find that most of the complexity is managed by LiteX and LitePCIe. The SoC itself only has an MMAP interface, DMA interface, and integrates the specific SDR/RFIC cores and features. ⚙️
- It provides debugging over PCIe or JTAG for MMAP peek & poke or LiteScope. 🛠️
- [LitePCIe](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litepcie) and its Linux driver (sorry, we only provide Linux support for now 😅) have been battle-tested on several commercial projects. 🏆

The PCIe design has already been validated at the maximum AD9361 specified sample rate: 2T2R @ 61.44MSPS (and also seems to correctly handle the oversampling at 2T2R @ 122.88MSPS with 7.9 Gbps of bandwidth on the PCIe bus; this oversampling feature is already in place and more tests/experiments will be done with it in the future).

[> Ethernet SoC Design (1/2.5Gbps x 1 or 2).
--------------------------------------------
<a id="ethernet-soc-design"></a>

> [!WARNING]
>
> **WiP** 🧪 Still in the lab, RX only for now!

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbcc0c79-4ae8-4e5b-94d8-aa7aff89bae2" width="100%">
</div>

The Ethernet design variant will gives flexibility when deploying the SDR. The PCIe connector has 4 SerDes transceivers that are in most cases used for... PCIe :) But these are 4 classical GTP transceivers of the Artix7 FPGA that are connected to the PCIe Hardened PHY in the case of a PCIe application but that can be used for any other SerDes-based protocol: Ethernet 1000BaseX/2500BaseX, SATA, etc...

In this design, the PCIe core will then be replaced with [LiteEth](https://github.com/enjoy-digital/liteeth), providing the 1000BaseX or 2500BaseX PHY but also the UDP/IP hardware stack + Streaming/Etherbone front-end cores.

The Ethernet SoC design is RX capable only for now. TX support will come soon.

[> Getting Started
------------------
<a id="quick-start"></a>

### For SDR Enthusiasts

If you are an SDR enthusiast looking to get started with the LiteX-M2SDR board, follow these simple steps to get up and running quickly:

1. **Install Prerequisite Packages:**
   - On a fresh Ubuntu system, install the required development and SDR packages to ensure compatibility with the LiteX-M2SDR software. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake libsoapysdr-dev libsndfile1-dev libsamplerate0-dev
   ```
   - **Note**: For non-Ubuntu Linux distributions (e.g., Fedora, Arch), install the equivalent packages using your distribution's package manager (e.g., `dnf` for Fedora or `pacman` for Arch).

2. **Connect the Board:**
   - Insert the LiteX-M2SDR board into an available M2 slot on your Linux computer and connect your antennas.

3. **Install Required Software:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary software installed on your Linux system. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   sudo apt install git cmake gnuradio gnuradio-dev soapysdr-tools libsoapysdr0.8 libsoapysdr-dev libgnuradio-soapy3.10.9t64 gqrx-sdr
   ```

> [!WARNING]
>
> If an error related to DKMS appears during installation, run sudo apt remove --purge xtrx-dkms dkms and then re-execute the installation command.

4. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the LiteX-M2SDR repository using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex_m2sdr
   ```

5. **Build and Install Software:**
    Software build use make and cmake for the C kernel driver and utilities, but since we also like Python 😅, we created a small script on top if it to simplify our developpment and installation:
   - Navigate to the software directory and run the build script:
   ```
   cd litex_m2sdr/software
   ./build.py
   ```
   - This will build the necessary components including the kernel driver, user-space utilities, and the SoapySDR driver.

6. **Load the Kernel Driver:**
   - Load the kernel driver with the following commands:
   ```
   cd litex_m2sdr/software/kernel
   make clean all
   sudo make install
   sudo insmod m2sdr.ko (To avoid having to reboot the machine)
   ```
   - 🚀 Ready for launch!

7. **Run Your SDR Software:**
   - Now, you can launch your preferred SDR software (like GQRX or GNU Radio) and select the LiteX-M2SDR board through SoapySDR. 📡

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see I/Q data streams in your SDR app, make sure IOMMU is set to passthrough mode. Add the following to your GRUB configuration:
>
> **x86/PC**:
> ```bash
> # Add to GRUB config (/etc/default/grub):
> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="iommu=pt"
> sudo update-grub && sudo reboot
> ```
>
> **ARM (ex NVIDIA Jetson/Orin)**:
> ```bash
> # Add to extlinux.conf (/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf):
> APPEND ... iommu.passthrough=1 arm-smmu.disable=1
> sudo reboot
> ```

> [!WARNING]
> For intel CPU: if a *kernel panic* occurs with the message **Corrupted page table at address**,
> add `intel_iommu=off` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`. (This has been observed on
> an *11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11700B @ 3.20GHz*)
